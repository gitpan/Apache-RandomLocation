To install the module and man pages in the standard areas, 
give the sequence of commands

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

If you want to install the module in your own private space, use

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/private/perllib \
       INSTALLMAN1DIR=/my/private/perllib/man/man1 \
       INSTALLMAN3DIR=/my/private/perllib/man/man3      
  make
  make test
  make install

Any libraries installed in such non-standard places may then
need to have the appropriate path to them specified in the script.

Note that `make test` simply tests whether the module loads OK.

Documentation on the use of the module can be found by running
  perldoc RandomLocation.pm
before installation, or
  man Apache::RandomLocation
after installation.
